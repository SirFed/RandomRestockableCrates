Random Restocable Crates for Loot

This is an unofficial update to 1.12.2, everything seems to be working expect for animations of opening/closing crates and sounds. I disabled those features so the mod can at least function on 1.12.2.

This was my first time ever working on a mod for Minecraft, so I aplogize for any bad coding practices I may not be aware of.
