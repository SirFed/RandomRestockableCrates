Random Restocable Crates for Loot

This is an unofficial update to 1.12.2, everything seems to be working expect for animations of opening/closing crates and sounds. I disabled those features so the mod can at least function on 1.12.2.

This was my first time ever working on a mod for Minecraft, so I aplogize for any bad coding practices I may not be aware of.

The mod is now available on CurseForge! Check it out at: https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/random-restockable-crates-unofficial-update



-----Changelog-----

Current Release 1.4.0

This is the first release of Random Restockable Crates compatible with 1.12.2

Known Issues:
-No sounds play when opening or closing a crate, this feature was removed since it was causing crashes on the server side.

-There is no animation for opening or closing the crates, this was causing the block to render as completely transparent.

-Currently not compatible with Recurrent Complex and causes the game to crash.
